# SurrogateRsq 0.1.0

## Major features

1. This pacakge has four main functions: rsq, surr_rsq, surr_rsq_ci, and surr_rsq_rank.

2. surr_rsq() is a function for producing a point estimate of the surrogate R-squared for a user-specified model.

2. surr_rsq_ci() is a function for generating an interval measure of the surrogate R-squared with the designated confidence level.

2. surr_rsq_rank() is a function to produce a ranking of explanatory variables based on
their contributions to the overall surrogate R-squared.

2. rsq() is a function to produce other pseudo R-squared measures in the literature.
