Description: This package implements the tools for the goodness-of-fit analysis for the probit
              model (Dungang Liu, Xiaorui Zhu, Brandon Greenwell, and Zewei Lin (2022)). This
              package can generate a point or interval measure of the surrogate $R^2$. It can
              also provide a ranking measure of each variable's contribution in terms of surrogate
              goodness-of-fit measure. This ranking assessment allows one to check the importance 
              of each variable in terms of their explained variance.
